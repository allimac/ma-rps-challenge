**week 3 / weekend challenge**

# The challenge

This weekend challenge is to create a Rock/Paper/Scissor Game using our newly learned skills in Ruby/Sinatra/HTML/CSS.
NOTE: Please excuse the use of Ruby $global variables; we haven't yet touched on databases during the course!

## User stories

```
As a user
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing the game

As a user
So that I can play my turn
I need to be able to choose one option between paper/scissors/rock

As a user
So that I can play against the computer
I need to be able to see the choice the computer has made

As a user
So that I can see who won the turn
I need to see a confirmation of who won the turn

As a user
So that I can see if the turn was tie
I need to see a confirmation that the turn was tie

As a user
So that I can see who is more likely to win
I need to see a summary of the score for each turn

As a user
So that I can see who won the game
I need to see a confirmation of who won the game when the score reaches 3

```

# Implementation

My implementation was driven by acceptance unit test cycles.
